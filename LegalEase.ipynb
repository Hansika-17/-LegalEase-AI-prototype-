            " This is a simplified version of your rental agreement for a room in Sunrise Hostel.  As a freelancer (and student), here's what's most important:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Points for You (the Freelancer/Tenant):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Rent:** You must pay ₹10,000 per month by the 1st of each month.  **Late payment results in a ₹2,000 penalty.** (**Obligation, Penalty, Payment Details, Timeline**)\n",
            "* **Security Deposit:** You'll pay a ₹50,000 security deposit.  You get it back only at the end of your 12-month lease *if* the landlord is happy with the condition of the room. (**Payment Details, Timeline**)\n",
            "* **Early Termination:** If you leave before August 31st, 2026, you'll pay a hefty ₹20,000 penalty. (**Penalty, Timeline**)\n",
            "* **Notice Period:**  You must give the landlord 4 months' notice if you plan to move out. (**Obligation, Timeline**)\n",
            "* **Maintenance:** You are responsible for ALL repairs, no matter what caused them.  This is a very unusual and potentially unfair clause for a tenant.  Consider negotiating this. (**Obligation**)\n",
            "* **Visitors:** Overnight guests are not allowed.  Each violation costs ₹5,000. (**Penalty, Obligation**)\n",
            "* **Rent Increase:**  After six months, your rent can increase by 15% without warning. This is a significant risk. (**Obligation**)\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Summary of the Agreement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "You're renting Room 105 at Sunrise Hostel in Bangalore from September 1st, 2025, to August 31st, 2026.  The agreement details your obligations (paying rent, maintaining the property, giving notice), penalties for breaking the rules (late rent, early move-out, overnight guests), payment details (rent, security deposit), and relevant timelines (monthly rent payment, notice period, lease end date).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:**  The clause making you responsible for all repairs is highly unusual in tenant agreements. This should be renegotiated. You may want to seek legal advice before signing this contract.  The rent increase clause also significantly impacts your budget and needs careful consideration.\n",
            "\n",
            "⚠️ Risk Factor Analysis:\n",
            " I would assign this rental agreement a risk score of **8 out of 10**.  This is because it contains several clauses heavily weighted in favor of the landlord and includes significant potential for financial penalties for the tenant.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown based on your criteria:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **High Penalties (Score: 9/10):** The penalties are excessively high.  A INR 20,000 penalty for breaking the lease early (clause 7) is disproportionate to the monthly rent. Similarly, INR 5,000 per overnight visitor (clause 10) is also very steep.  The late fee of INR 2,000 (clause 6) is also relatively high compared to the monthly rent.  These penalties create significant financial risk for the tenant.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Ambiguous Terms (Score: 4/10):**  The phrase \"Landlord is fully satisfied\" in clause 4 regarding the security deposit is highly ambiguous. This leaves the tenant with no clear understanding of what constitutes \"fully satisfied\" and gives the landlord significant subjective power over the return of a substantial sum of money.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Unfair Obligations (Score: 8/10):** Clause 9, where the tenant is responsible for *all* repairs regardless of cause, is extremely unfair.  This could expose the tenant to significant unexpected costs.  The 4-month notice requirement (clause 5) is also relatively long compared to standard rental agreements.  The unilateral 15% rent increase without notice (clause 8) is highly unreasonable.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **One-sided Clauses (Score: 9/10):** The majority of the contract's clauses heavily favor the landlord.  The tenant bears the brunt of most risks and responsibilities, while the landlord retains significant discretion and limited obligations.  There are few protections for the tenant.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall:** The combination of high penalties, ambiguous terms, unfair obligations, and overwhelmingly one-sided clauses makes this a very risky agreement for the tenant.  The tenant should strongly consider negotiating these terms or seeking legal advice before signing.  A significantly revised contract would be needed to bring the risk down to an acceptable level.\n",
            "\n",
            "❓ Q&A Response:\n",
            " The agreement allows the landlord to increase the rent by 15% after 6 months without prior notice.  Refusing the rent hike doesn't prevent the increase; the landlord can still raise the rent.\n",
